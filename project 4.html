						This project course, CSE 3902: Design, Development, and Documentation of Interactive Systems, was a class conducted on the OSU campus.
						I participated in this class on a team of five other people. The project's main goal was to explore, research,
						and develop the C# language and the XNA Framework to code in Visual Studio a new or replicate 8-bit video game.
						<br>
						<br>
						This course, and project, lasted one college semester (4 months). Over the course of this semester, I worked with five other
						classmates to code one final project together. The choices for project topics included replicating Mario, replicating Legend
						of Zelda, or creating a new video game with the approval of the course instructor.
						<br>
						<br>
						My team's choice of project topic was to replicate Super Mario Bros. Along with the end goal of replicating the video game,
						we were also tasked with modifying the game with our own choice(s) of extra additions. Our team chose to add the utility of placing
						bricks back down that had been broken by the player already, similar to how Minecraft might work. We also decided to add a
						quality-of-life addition where the levels had different biomes which would alter the colors and sprites of blocks, enemies, powers, and the player.

						<br>
						In regards to the more professional side of work, our team also did the following: Worked together through GitHub. Scheduled meetings for the team.
						Documented work to be done and work that has been completed. Communicated with each other to not overlap work too much, but to have code that works well with others' code.
						<br>
						<br>
						According to the class rules, our team worked on a Sprint workflow. The semester had five sprints total, with about three weeks for each.
						Our team had one person who would lead each sprint, and would therefore be in charge of the documentation, planning, and general overseeing
						of everyone. I was in charge of leading Sprint 3, Sprint 4, and Sprint5.
						<br>
						<br>
						As such, I took charge of documentation for planning, making sure everyone
						was communicating well and often with everyone, and making sure everyone was completing tasks by planned deadlines. To end the sprint, I would make sure
						we had everyone's code, code reviews, and all other documentation in the GitHub repository. And then I would compress the repo and submit the .zip file
						for grading.
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						For the sake of keeping my team members' names anonymous, if interested in seeing the code, documentation, learning more about this project, or obtaining the game executable
						to play what we created, feel free to contact me by email and I can send more information or files based on what you might be interested in.
