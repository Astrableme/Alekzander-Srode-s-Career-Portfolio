						I hope to obtain a full-time job involving the application of software design and research, use of coding skills in any language, prferrably C/C#,
						and strong group collaboration and team communication.
						<br>
						<br>
						I am finishing my final year of college at The Ohio State University where I am studying Computer Science and Engineering with specialization in AI technology.
						I hope to be graduating in early May of 2023. So I hope to be able to take on a full-time job as soon as I have gotten through commencement. 
						The specifics I'm most looking for in a job, but not necessarily need, are:
						<ol type="1">
							<li>The chance to use my skill in programming, such as coding in C/C#, Java, Python, etc.</li>
							<li>Opportunities to work on challenging tasks that will lead to personal, group, and especially company goals</li>
							<li>The chance to work with other people to use my communication and collaboration skills I have built up throughout college and my work experiences</li>
						</ol>
						In my work, I enjoy a challenge, and am always willing to take on anything no matter the difficulty of the task.
						For me, it is most important that work or a project is finished, and finished with effort and care. Because of this,
						once I start work on an assigned project, I put my time and effort into making sure the job is well done and thoroughly complete.
						<br>
						<br>
						My goal when working for my company and team is to be a model employee and coworker, open to all types of ideas and work, and provide help and encouragement to all my team members and other coworkers.
						I want to be a positive and helpful member of the company and work to improve the community and ethics of the business. I especially want to put my best foot forward,
						and work my hardest to produce the best possible work. And outside of work, I want to be a leading example of what our company means
						and provides for the public.
