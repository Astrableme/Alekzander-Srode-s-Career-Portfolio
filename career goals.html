						I expect to obtain an internship, part-time, or full-time job opportunity applying software design and research, use of C/C# skills,
						and excellent group collaboration.
						<br>
						<br>
						Currently, I am taking classes at The Ohio State University and majoring in Computer Science and Engineering with specialization in AI.
						While taking my classes and over the summer, I am looking for an internship or co-op that might allow me to:
						<ol type="1">
							<li>Use my skill in programming, such as coding in C/C#</li>
							<li>Work to help research, design, and code software for commercial or testing uses</li>
							<li>Work with other people to use and improve my communication and group collaboration skills</li>
						</ol>
						In my work, I enjoy a challenge, and am always willing to take on anything no matter the difficulty of the task.
						It is most important to finish any work or a project, rather then managing to start new ones. Because of this,
						once I start work on an assigned project, I put my time and effort into making sure the job is well done and thoroughly complete.
						<br>
						<br>
						My goal when working for my company is to be a model employee and open to all types of ideas and work. I want to be a positive and
						helpful member of the company and improve the community and work ethics of the business. I also want to put my best foot forward,
						and work my hardest to produce the best possible work. And outside of work, I want to be a leading example of what our company means
						and provides for the public.
