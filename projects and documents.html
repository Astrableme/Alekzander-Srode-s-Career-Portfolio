						I have worked in groups with other people at OSU and from other places around the United States.
						The below list gives a general overview and link to more indepth detail on each of the projects I have participated in and documented on this website.

								<span class="smaller">
									This project course, CSE 3902: Design, Development, and Documentation of Interactive Systems, was a class conducted on the OSU campus.
									I participated in this class on a team of five other people. The project's main goal was to explore, research,
									and develop the C# language and the XNA Framework to code in Visual Studio a new or replicate 8-bit video game.
									<br>
									<br>
									This course, and project, lasted one college semester (4 months). Over the course of this semester, I worked with five other
									classmates to code one final project together. The choices for project topics included replicating Mario, replicating Legend
									of Zelda, or creating a new video game with the approval of the course instructor.

									This project/program, Summer At Discovery's Edge (SADE), was conducted by the company Discover Lab Global (DLG).
									I participated in this program on a team of five other people. The project's main goal was to explore, research,
									and develop a space in Virtual Reality where information can be easily stored, organized, shared, and expanded.
									<br>
									<br>
									I experienced work in a virtual environment, learned some Linden Script Language (LSL), as well as some Python.
									I also worked with others to research technology and create documentation to present the team's research to the
									project lead. I also got a better understanding of the virtual world and what uses researchers are considering
									for the virtual environment. I also learned a good amount of how different softwares might interact with one another.

							<li class="leftSide"><a href="project 2.html">Spring 2020: OSU Engineering Robot</a></li>
								<span class="smaller">
									This project was done in the ENGR 1282.01H class at The Ohio State University in a team with three other people.
									The goal of the project was to create an automated robot that would complete certain tasks on a model course of a
									diner. Tasks included flipping a model burger patty. Flipping an ice cream lever down, waiting 7 seconds, then
									flipping it back up. Pressing a button corresponding to a certain light color. And a few other tasks. Following
									completion of the robot and performance tests made to test the robot's capabilities, the team produced a final
									write-up documentation the outcome of the project.
									<br>
									<br>
									Over the course of the project, I took charge of documentation, budget and time tracking, and project management.
									I also participated heavily in coding, testing, and construction of the robot. The provided write-up was the
									documentation that I worked on with my group members covering our team's content of the robot project.

							<li class="leftSide"><a href="project 3.html">Fall 2019: OSU Engineering Quality & Productivity Lab</a></li>
								<span class="smaller">
									This was part of a lab conducted in the ENGR 1281.01H class at The Ohio State University in a group with eleven others.
									The goal of the lab was to create a model factory meant to efficiently and quickly produce fully assembled toys, which
									were Mr. Potato heads in this scenario.
									<br>
									<br>
									In the lab, I had the role of Final Tester, as mentioned in the provided documentation. The provided write-up was the
									documentation I worked on with three others covering the lab overview.
